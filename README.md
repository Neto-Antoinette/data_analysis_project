I completed the following steps in the store_income_task.ipynb:
Loaded a supporting csv file.
Highlighted values in the "country" column. Then I was taskied with converting the column entries to lower case and remove any trailing white spaces.
I was also tasked to clean up the “country” column so that there are three distinct countries.
Finally I created a new column called `days_ago` in the Data Frame that is a copy of the “date_measured” column in the supporting CSV file, but instead displays a number that represents the number of days ago that it was measured instead of dates.
